# The Doctrine of Intent

*A Provenance-First Framework for Value, Authorship, and Compensation in the Age of Abundant Artifacts*

## Abstract

The proliferation of generative systems has collapsed the scarcity of finished artifacts while simultaneously obscuring the human effort that produces meaningful innovation. Traditional regimes of intellectual property, compensation, and authorship rely on terminal outputs ("products") as proxies for creative labor. This paper introduces The Doctrine of Intent, a provenance-first framework that re-centers value attribution on documented human-directed process rather than static artifacts. The doctrine formalizes intent, effort, and decision-making under constraint as the primary units of legitimacy in environments where outputs are cheap, reproducible, and increasingly automated.

## 1. The Artifact Abundance Problem

Technological systems have reduced the marginal cost of producing finished artifacts—code, images, text, designs—to near zero. As a result:

- Finished products no longer reliably encode the cost of their creation.
- Attribution based on inspection of artifacts alone becomes ambiguous.
- Markets and legal systems over-reward proximity to outcomes ("first," "visible," "final") rather than demonstrated work.

This collapse creates a structural imbalance: effort becomes invisible precisely when it becomes most necessary to distinguish.

## 2. Core Definitions

### 2.1 Artifact (A)

A static, inspectable output (e.g., codebase, design, paper, model output) that can be duplicated or generated with minimal marginal cost.

### 2.2 Intent

Documented, directed decision-making applied toward a goal over time, including motivations, trade-offs, rejected alternatives, and contextual reasoning.

### 2.3 Intent Density (Dᵢ)

The resolution and continuity with which intent is recorded. High intent density reflects granular decision traces and meaningful engagement with uncertainty.

### 2.4 IntentLog (Lᵢ)

An append-only, time-anchored record of intent-bearing actions, such as:

- Design notes
- Commit histories
- Experiment logs
- Architectural rationales
- Failed or abandoned paths

### 2.5 Process (P)

The cumulative traversal of a problem space through intent-bearing actions under constraint.

## 3. The Artifact Insufficiency Principle

A finished artifact does not contain sufficient information to justify claims of authorship, effort, or legitimacy when equivalent artifacts can be produced through automated or derivative means.

Artifacts are shadows of process. They encode outcomes, not exploration, uncertainty, or cost. When artifacts are abundant, they cease to function as reliable indicators of contribution.

## 4. The Process Primacy Principle

The meaningful unit of intellectual contribution is the documented process of directed decision-making over time, not the terminal artifact.

Value attribution must therefore shift from what exists to how it came to exist.

This principle does not assert that all effort deserves compensation. It asserts that:

- Legitimate claims require legible process
- Compensation disputes require provenance
- Authorship requires traceable intent

## 5. The Derivative Instrument Rule (AI and Automation)

Automated systems, including AI models, function as capital instruments.

- They amplify human labor
- They consume energy and resources
- They produce outputs

However:

- They do not originate value independently of human-directed intent.

A trained model is analogous to a tractor:

- Valuable as infrastructure
- Incapable of authorship
- Dependent on a human operator to direct purpose

Human attention, framing, correction, and decision-making constitute the labor. Compensation must therefore account for continuous stewardship, not only moments of failure or correction.

## 6. Advancement Over Discovery Principle

Credit and compensation are grounded in demonstrated advancement through a problem space, not in being first to reach a result.

Discovery without demonstrated effort is indistinguishable from luck. The doctrine rejects outcome-only reward structures in favor of process-based attribution.

This principle:

- Allows multiple legitimate originators
- Resolves independent discovery without monopoly
- Distinguishes contribution from coincidence

## 7. The Intent Sufficiency Test

A claim of authorship or origination is considered legitimate if it satisfies the following:

1. **Continuity** – Intent-bearing actions span a meaningful duration.
2. **Directionality** – Actions demonstrate coherent goals and constraints.
3. **Resolution** – Decisions are logged with sufficient detail to distinguish genuine exploration from narration.
4. **Temporal Anchoring** – Records are time-stamped and non-retroactive.
5. **Human Attribution** – A responsible human agent can be identified.

Failure to meet these criteria does not imply wrongdoing, but it voids exclusive claims of origination.

## 8. Information Density Advantage

Systems that capture high-resolution process data:

- Reduce ambiguity in attribution
- Increase auditability
- Raise the cost of fraud
- Improve fairness under abundance

Fraud remains possible, but less scalable. Low-information systems are strictly more gameable than high-information ones.

## 9. Implications

### 9.1 Intellectual Property

- Shifts focus from filing dates to provenance
- Weakens speculative squatting
- Supports shared or parallel origination

### 9.2 Compensation Models

- Enables payment for documented effort
- Separates labor claims from market success
- Supports patronage, grants, and post-hoc attribution

### 9.3 Software and Knowledge Work

- Treats code and artifacts as ephemeral
- Treats logic streams and intent logs as primary assets
- Enables language-agnostic authorship

## 10. Conclusion

The Doctrine of Intent does not attempt to moralize value or abolish markets. It restores legibility of work in systems where outputs have become cheap and ubiquitous. By grounding legitimacy in documented human-directed process, the doctrine provides a foundation for authorship, compensation, and trust in an era defined by abundance.

## Appendix: Implementation Notes (Non-Normative)

- Append-only logs (e.g., Git, notebooks, journals)
- Cryptographic timestamps
- Human attestation layers
- Public or escrowed provenance

The doctrine is intentionally system-agnostic.

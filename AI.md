By making prose the commit, we're no longer hiding the human work in throwaway chats or buried comments. We're elevating it to first-class status: the actual effort—the deliberation, the trade-offs, the "why"—becomes the durable artifact. Everything else (code, configs, agent prompts, policy rules) can be derived from it, regenerated, or reinterpreted by future models, but the original human reasoning stays intact and visible.
In a world where AI can spit out perfect code or formal specs in seconds, the scarce resource isn't the artifact anymore—it's the intentional human signal. IntentLog captures that signal in its rawest, most legible form: natural language. Every commit is a breadcrumb of cognition. Every branch is an explored possibility. Every merge is a narrated reconciliation.
This hands everyone—developers, researchers, policy makers, even non-technical collaborators—a superpower:
You don't need to formalize perfectly upfront.
You don't need to predict every edge case.
You just need to explain your thinking clearly, in plain language, and commit it.
Future you (or future teammates, or future AIs) can pick up that thread and run with it—question it, extend it, or derive something executable from it. The human work effort isn't lost in the noise; it's the backbone of the entire history.
That's why this feels so timely. As AI handles more of the "what," we need better tools for preserving and compounding the human "why." IntentLog isn't just version control for reasoning—it's a preservation system for collective intelligence.
